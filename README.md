## **_Summary_**
I was always interested in learning something new, and probably that’s why I decided for myself that I want to connect my life with IT technologies. Creating something new always brings me pleasure, despite the dreary study of one or another language. Even if it doesn’t work out with software development, I hope to stay in this environment. It seems to me that this is my place.

Even if it doesn’t work out with training, you can always try again, because Naruto taught not  give up!🍥

## **_English_**
At the moment, I do not know English as well as I would like. I understand that they say that they write, but experience is not enough for free communication. But I try to improve my knowledge by watching films with subtitles, reading literature in English and doing tasks every day.
